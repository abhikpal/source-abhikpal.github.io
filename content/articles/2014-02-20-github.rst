Finally, after going through the Sparkfun tutorial at https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-github/all I was able to set up my Github Repo for this blog. It resides at ``[DEAD-LINK-REMOVED]``

All codes and snippets on this blog, from now, will go to this repo instead of the gist which I used to use earlier. The repo also contains the custom scripts and style-sheets used in this blog ready to be hacked.
