My proposal to the Google Summer of Code was accepted and I'll be
spending the summer working on `p5 <https://p5py.github.io/>`_. It's a
native Python library that will expose an API similar to Processing's.

Use one of the links below to know more about the project:

- The Google Summer of Code `project page <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5809403503575040>`_.
- The `code repository <https://github.com/p5py/p5>`_ on Github.
- The `project documentation <https://p5.readthedocs.io/>`_.
- ...and the `website for the project <https://p5py.github.io/>`_.

I plan to use this blog to post ocassional updates about the
development process/other things; there are `RSS
<https://abhikpal.github.io/feeds/all.rss.xml>`_/`ATOM
<https://abhikpal.github.io/feeds/all.atom.xml>`_ feeds you can
subscribe to if you want to follow along.

If you'd rather play around with ``p5``, I've uploaded a `developmental
release <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/p5>`_ to the Python Package Index. The installation instructions are
in the documentation page and the Github `README
<https://github.com/p5py/p5/blob/master/README.rst>`_.
